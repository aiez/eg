The computing scientists main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of (their) own making.    
-- E.W. Dijkstra

As complexity rises, precise statements lose meaning, and meaningful statements lose precision.

Don't use a big word where a diminutive one will suffice.

Why is "abbreviation" such a long word?

## A "Simplicity-first" Approach to AI

Before you waste time and money and   much CPU to generate
complex and opaque AI models, perhaps it is prudent to first try something simple.
All the AI methods explored here are quick to code and execute. 
At  the very least, they will  quickly
generate an
baseline AI model against which you demonstrate the  superiority   of  some other, seemingly more sophisticated, method.
And at the very most, if these simple methods work well, then you have avoided all that extra modeling.

But ultimately it is an experimental issue whether or not simplicity-first works for some new problem.
Hence, we call this book
"Is AI Simple?". Also, we invite you to apply its methods to your problems, then report back the results.
In this way, with time, we will build up lists of problems that should (or should not) be tackled
using
simpler AI.


This book is in two parts. Firstly, some case studies
are presented where "simplicity-first" performed very well indeed.

Second, there are   
15 coding challenges aimed at teaching programmers how to write simpler AI
systems:

-  Each challenge comes with a fully working solutions, which
you need to 
your favorite language.
You have mastered the challenge when your unit tests produce similar output to our unit tests.
- These challenges could be used as a guided self-study or as the basis of a graduate class on programming AI
systems.
Each challenge comes with just enough theory to understand the problem, as well as numerous suggestions on how
this code might be improved.
